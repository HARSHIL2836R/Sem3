The Structure of Stack is:
    $ra
    a4 val to check
    $a3 end
    $a2 start
    $a1 len
    $a0 Address of Array

Stack Depth will be maximum when the number of function calls is maximum, that would be in the case when the value is not in the array (when condition end > start will evaluate to true), the breakpoint should be at line 95: addi $v0, $s5 in the branch ret_false to see the stack at it's maximum size

The call activation record would look like:
    1. main 
    2. binarySearch(A,10,0,9,15)->upper
    2. binarySearch(A,10,5,9,15)->upper
    2. binarySearch(A,10,8,9,15)->upper
    2. binarySearch(A,10,9,9,15)->upper
    2. binarySearch(A,10,10,9,15)->ret_false
