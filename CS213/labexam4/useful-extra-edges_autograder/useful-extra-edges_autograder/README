Copy your "useful-extra-edges.cpp" to this current directory.
Run `python3 grade.py` (or `python grade.py` depending on what is available) to evaluate.

There are 7 testcases in `testcases/`. First 6 are 1 mark each and the last one is worth 2.

Straight 0 if your code doesn't compile.
Straight 0 if there are more than 1 #include in your .cpp file.

A possible correct solution is present in `solution/`.
